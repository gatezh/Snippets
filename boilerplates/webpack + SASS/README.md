- `npm-check-updates`
- Add linters


## Webpack

Webpack performs the following:

1. HTML
     - Copies *index.html* from *src* to *dist*
2. CSS
    - Transpile SASS into CSS
    - Extracts styles into the separate file
    - Adds prefixes
    - Does NOT process images (e.g. just copies *assets* folder to *dist*)
3. Javascript
    - Performs Babel magic


## Dependencies

`npm-check-updates` package is included in dependencies to make it easier to update dependencies.
