## HTML Form Elements

1. `<fieldset>` – groups related form questions 
2. `<legend>` – follows the HTML for the `<fieldset>` and provides a label for the group of fields
3. Text fields:
	- `<input type="text">`
	- `<input type="password">`
	- `<textarea>`

4. Buttons `<input type=“submit”>`
5. Drop-down menus created by the `<select>` tag


## Form pseudo-classes
`:focus` pseudo-class lets you create a selector that changes the way a text field looks when a visitor clicks or tabs inside it (this is called giving the field focus).

`:checked` pseudo-class works with radio buttons and checkboxes.

You can only change the state of a form element (from disabled to enabled, for example) using JavaScript, so you’ll need to learn that to really take advantage of the `:enabled` or `:disabled` pseudo-classes.
