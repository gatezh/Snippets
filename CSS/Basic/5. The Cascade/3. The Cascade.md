## The Cascade

CSS provides a formula for determining a style’s specificity that’s based on a value assigned to the style’s selector—a tag selector, class selector, ID selector, and so on. Here’s how the system works:

- A `tag` selector is worth **1 point**.
- A `class` selector is worth **10 points**.
- An `ID` selector is worth **100 points**.
- An `inline style` is worth **1,000 points**.
