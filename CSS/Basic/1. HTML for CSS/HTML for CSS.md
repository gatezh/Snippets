## Tips

- To create a glossary of terms and their definitions or descriptions, use the `<dl>` (definition list) tag in conjunction with the `<dt>` (definition term) and `<dd>` (definition description) tags.

- If you want to include a quotation like a snippet of text from another website, a movie review, or just some wise saying of your grandfatherâ€™s, try the `<blockquote>` tag for long passages or the `<q>` tag to place a short quote within a longer paragraph, like this:

 ```html
<p>Mark Twain is said to have written <q>The The coldest winter I ever spent
was a summer in San Francisco</q>. Unfortunately, he never actually wrote that famous quote.</p>
```

- Take advantage of obscure tags like the `<cite>` tag for referencing a book title, newspaper article, or website, and the `<address>` tag to identify and supply contact information for the author of a page (great for a copyright notice).
